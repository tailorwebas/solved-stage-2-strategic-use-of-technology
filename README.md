<strong>Assignment</strong>




The first step is to incorporate the feedback you received on your Stage 1 assignment, making any needed corrections or adjustments.  For this assignment, you will <strong>add</strong> Section II of the Business Analysis and System Recommendation (BA&amp;SR) and identify and explain how the organization in the case study can use technology for strategic purposes in the areas listed below.  This analysis lays the ground work for Section III – Strategic and Operational Outcomes of the BA&amp;SR (Stage 3 assignment) which will explain how technology can be used to support the strategic outcomes of the organization.




Using the case study, assignment instructions, Course Content readings, and external resources, develop your Section II on Strategic Use of Technology.   Approximate lengths for each section are provided as a guideline; be sure to provide all pertinent information




As you review the case study, including the description of CIC as well as the “interviews” that are documented, list opportunities for CIC to use technology for <strong>strategic</strong> purposes in the areas of:  decision making, communication, collaboration, relationships, structure, and competitive advantage.   Keep in mind, these are to be aligned to the business strategy and the organizational goals; the uses described in this section should not be just automating manual processes.  Begin with Section I (the Stage 1 assignment), making changes based on feedback you received and add Section II.  <strong>Note:  In addition to the criteria for Stage 2, as indicated in the grading rubric, the incorporation of improvements based on substantive feedback (more significant problems with content) from the previous stage will also be evaluated.  </strong>




Apply specific information from the case study to address <strong>each</strong> area listed below.




<ol>

 <li><strong>Strategic Use of Technology </strong>

  <ol>

   <li><strong>Decision-Making </strong>– In the Information Systems course module (included in the Week 4 Learning Resources), you were introduced to the information requirements of various levels of the organization.

Then, for each of the processes listed below, complete the table with the appropriate level) and an example of a decision supported by the Hiring System to be made at that level.
